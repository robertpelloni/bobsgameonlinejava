# Handoff - December 26, 2025

## Session Summary
*   **Objective**: Update project infrastructure, merge branches, update submodules, and implement "Palette Synchronization".
*   **Status**: Successful.
*   **Version**: Bumped to `0.1.3`.

## Key Changes
1.  **Git Operations**:
    *   Merged all local feature branches (`modernize-*`, `new-feature-branch`) into `main`.
    *   Updated all submodules to latest upstream commits (significant updates in `GeoIP2-java` and `lz4-java`).
2.  **Feature Implementation**:
    *   **Palette Synchronization**: Implemented in `TilesetPalette.java`. Sorting or adding colors now affects all palettes in the project to maintain consistency.
3.  **Documentation**:
    *   Updated `LLM_INSTRUCTIONS.md` with strict versioning protocols.
    *   Updated `docs/dashboard.md` with current submodule status.
    *   Updated `CHANGELOG.md` and `ROADMAP.md`.
    *   Incremented `VERSION.md`.

## Next Steps
*   **Project Merging**: The user requested "merge maps/tilesets/palettes into one". This is the next feature to implement. It likely involves importing data from another project zip file into the current one.
*   **Undo System**: "make undo better" is on the todo list.
*   **Map Management**: "move map up/down" is partially implemented in `Project.java` but needs UI verification.

## Notes for Next Agent
*   The project uses a custom zip-based file format. `Project.java` handles loading/saving.
*   `TilesetPalette.java` was recently modified.
*   Always check `VERSION.md` before making changes and increment it for new builds.
*   Submodules are critical; keep them updated.
